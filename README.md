# Langchain-GPT-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation
This Repo is for demonstration and using the Langchain framework. Here I tried to use the various tools provided by Langchain to be able to use a GPT 3.5 model and generate richer information output through augmentation. This was done using a datastore and langchain libraries such as Directory loader and Text loader were used.
